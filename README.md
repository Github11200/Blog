# Computer Studies Blog
This is a simple blog I made for my computer studies class.

## 📝 Overview
This blog contains 3 posts currently, all hardcoded into a JSON file (this was due to time constraints). Each post contains data about the author, their profile picture, the banner image for the post, and more. From these posts multiple links are dynamically created using React Router so that the user can access all the posts.

## 🛠️ Setup
Prequesites for running the program:
  - NPM
  - Node JS
  - Text editor (I will be using VS Code)

1) Download the source code
2) Open it in a text editor such as VS Code
3) From the built in terminal in VS Code run the command `npm run dev`.
4) This should give you a localhost link from which you can view the project.

## 🏗️ Tools used
The tools used to create this project are:
  - React JS
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Daisy UI
  - React Router
